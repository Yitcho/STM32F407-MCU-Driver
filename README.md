This carefully curated repository boasts an array of drivers, including GPIO, I2C, UART, and SPI, enabling you to effortlessly interface with various peripherals on STM32F407 microcontroller.

What's more, I've gone the extra mile to include a comprehensive BSP layer for RTC (Real-Time Clock) and a 16x2 LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). The RTC driver ensures accurate and reliable timekeeping, vital for time-sensitive applications, while the LCD driver simplifies communication with the popular 16x2 character display, making it a breeze to visualize data and user interfaces.

 Note : function descriptions will be updated shortly as I didn't update it in development phase
